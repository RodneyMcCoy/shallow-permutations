1. Count the number of shallow elements for each n
2. Count the number of shallow elements with only one cycle (NOT one pair of cycles) in the cycle decomposition for each n.  (The hope is that the answers here are the Schroeder numbers: 1, 2, 6, 22, 90, 394, 1806, … - but it’s worth typing the sequence into the OEIS if it’s something else.)
3. Find conjecture, make sure conjecture for type A does not work
